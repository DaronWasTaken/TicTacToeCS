# TicTacToeCS
A simple terminal TicTacToe game using C#. I've developed this thing during a Complete C# Masterclass course on Udemy, so I could refresh my memory a bit before proceeding to other more difficult tasks. There will probably be a lot more simple projects like this within the course. I plan to include them all on my github.

# Changelog:

# 1.0
This functional version is the first, and possibly the last. The only bug I have encountered is the draw during the restarted game bug. (if the game has ended in a draw and the game has been rest, then the next draw will crash the game). Other then that only some code refactoring could be involved, or possibly changing the whole thing to include hashmaps for complexity's sake, but for now - Please enjoy!
